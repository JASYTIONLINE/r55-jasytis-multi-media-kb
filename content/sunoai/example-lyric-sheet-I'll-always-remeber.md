## Lyrics  

### [Title] I'll Always Remember  

#### [Intro]  
I'll always remember the song they were playin'  

#### [Verse-1]  
I'll always remember the song they were playin'  
The first time we danced, hearts gently swayin'  
You held me close and I knew it was true  
That's when I fell in love with you  

#### [Verse-2]  
You light up my life — you gave me hope  
To carry on through darkest night  
Yes, you light up my life  
With your love and your light  

#### [Verse-3]  
Oh oh oh, we're goin' to the chapel  
And we're gonna get married  
Oh yes, we're goin' to the chapel  
Our hearts so bright and carried  

#### [Verse-4]  
If you love him, be proud of him  
Hold him close, let the world see  
‘Cause after all, through thick and thin  
He’s just a man — tryin’ to be free  

#### [Refrain-1]  
I'll always remember the song they were playin'  
The first time we danced, hearts gently swayin'  

#### [Verse-5]  
Sometimes it’s hard to be a woman  
Givin’ all your love to just one man  
He’ll have his flaws, you’ll feel the strain  
But love forgives again and again  

#### [Verse-6]  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
I’m beggin’ you now — please don’t take my man  
Jolene, Jolene, you know what I mean  
Don’t take him just because you can  

#### [Verse-7]  
Crazy — I’m crazy for feeling so lonely  
I’m crazy for thinkin’ you’d always be true  
But I kept on hopin’ you'd come back to me  
Instead, you left me feelin’ blue  

#### [Verse-8]  
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E  
Becomes final today  
What once was forever  
Just faded away  

#### [Refrain-1]  
I'll always remember the song they were playin'  

#### [Verse-9]  
I go out walkin’ after midnight  
Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do  
Still hear your voice in the breeze through the pine  
Midnight’s for searchin’ — searchin’ for you  

#### [Bridge]  
And when the light fades down so low  
And the music’s soft and slow  
I still see your face in dreams  
Dancin’ through forgotten scenes  
You’re gone but not erased from me  
Still waltzing in my memory  

#### [Verse-10]  
So many nights I sat by the window  
Waitin’ for someone to sing me their song  
So many dreams I held down deep  
Till your love came and made me strong  

#### [Refrain-2]  
I'll always remember the song they were playin'  
The first time we danced, hearts gently swayin'  

#### [Outro]  
Once a day, all day long  
Once a night from dusk till dawn  
The only time I don’t feel pain  
Is when I dream you back again  

#### [End]  
The first time we danced, hearts gently swayin'

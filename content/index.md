# JASYTI Multimedia Knowledge Base – HOME  

---

## Purpose  
This folder is the **root hub** for all of my knowledge about creating, producing, and distributing multimedia.  
It unifies workflows and resources for both **traditional media** (CDs, DVDs) and **digital platforms** (internet streaming, downloads, and online publication).  

The goal is to keep every aspect of **production → publishing → distribution** accessible in one place, so projects can move seamlessly from concept to release across multiple formats.

## How to Use This Site  

1. Start with the **PMO (Project Management Office)** to understand governance, workflows, and templates.  
2. Explore **Platforms** for strategies and references tied to YouTube, Twitch, Spotify, Suno AI, and others.  
3. Check **Production Tools** to see guides for specific applications like Video Express, HitFilm, OBS, and Suno AI.

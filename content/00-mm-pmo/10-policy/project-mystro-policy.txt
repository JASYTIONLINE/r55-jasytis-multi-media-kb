# üé∂ Project Mystro Manifesto  
**Policy for Crafting Effective Teaching Songs with Suno v4.5**  

---

## 1. Purpose  
The purpose of this policy is to provide a standardized yet flexible framework for creating teaching songs on **any subject** that:  
- Define concepts clearly.  
- Highlight comprehension or exam watch-outs.  
- Reinforce memory through hooks and repetition.  
- Remain musically listenable and engaging.  

---

## 2. Default Suno Version  
- The **default Suno version** for all teaching song creation is **4.5**.  
- Users must **check online regularly** for Suno release notes, updates, or community findings.  
- If new information arises about Suno‚Äôs behavior, prompting, or structure handling, this policy should be **refined and updated** accordingly.  

---

## 3. Hierarchy of Importance  
When building a SIG, not all descriptors are weighted equally by Suno. The following order should be respected, from most influential to least:  

1. **Genre** ‚Üí Suno locks onto this first (non-negotiable).  
2. **Mood** ‚Üí Strongest secondary influence.  
3. **Vocals** ‚Üí Defines timbre & delivery.  
4. **Instrumentation** ‚Üí Shapes sound palette.  
5. **Arrangement** ‚Üí Shapes song structure.  
6. **Production** ‚Üí Mix style (polished vs raw).  
7. **Energy** ‚Üí General intensity of performance.  
8. **Tempo** ‚Üí Human-level pacing.  
9. **Beat** ‚Üí Optional (defaults to 4/4 if not given).  
10. **BPM** ‚Üí Least important (Suno often defaults to range implied by Tempo + Genre).  

‚ö†Ô∏è *Practical Note:* Keep SIGs in the **7‚Äì9 descriptor range** (‚âà8 commas). Anything beyond tends to dilute effectiveness.  

## 4. Constraints (What Works and What Doesn‚Äôt)  

Suno v4.5 is powerful but limited. Understanding its constraints helps prevent wasted effort and inconsistent results.  

### 4.1 SIG Constraints  
- **Effective Range:** 7‚Äì9 descriptors (‚âà8 commas). More than this dilutes effect; fewer than 5 feels under-specified.  
- **Front-Loaded Weighting:** The first 500 characters matter most. Place **Genre, Mood, Vocals, and Instrumentation** first.  
- **Ignored Inputs:** After ~10 descriptors or long paragraph-style instructions, Suno begins to drop details.  
- **Negative Prompting Works:** Phrases like ‚Äúno long solos‚Äù or ‚Äúminimal instrumental‚Äù help prevent filler.  
- **Custom Bracketed Notes Don‚Äôt Work:** `[guitars quiet here]` or `[no long pauses]` are ignored ‚Äî only official tags are respected.  

### 4.2 Lyric Constraints  
- **Everything not in brackets is sung.** If you type ‚ÄúLyrics:‚Äù at the top, Suno will try to sing ‚ÄúLyrics.‚Äù  
- **Recognized Tags:** `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Refrain]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`, `[Instrumental Interlude]`, `[Percussion Break]`, `[Guitar Solo]`, `[End]`.  
- **Parentheses `( )`:** Treated as optional or echo lines. Sometimes sung softly, sometimes ignored.  
- **Length:** Songs longer than ~4 minutes tend to lose focus or repeat filler.  
- **Consistency:** Uneven syllable counts across lines cause stretched or rushed phrasing.  

### 4.3 Genre Constraints  
- **High-Level Canon Genres:** Pop, Rock, Metal, Punk, Country, Folk, Blues, Jazz, R&B, Soul, Electronic, EDM, House, Techno, Trance, Synthwave, Ambient, Hip Hop, Rap, Trap.  
- **Niche Genres Collapse:** Sub-genres like ‚ÄúShoegaze‚Äù or ‚ÄúAfrobeats‚Äù usually map back into broader canons (Shoegaze ‚Üí Rock/Indie; Afrobeats ‚Üí Pop/R&B/Electronic hybrid).  
- **Reliability:** Single-word high-level genres are the safest anchors.  

### 4.4 Structural Constraints  
- **Teaching Songs:** Must follow structured defaults (Intro, Verses, Refrains, Chorus, Bridge, Outro).  
- **Fun Songs:** Looser, but still benefit from short choruses, consistent meter, and no overlong solos.  
- **Instrumental Breaks:** Keep to 1‚Äì2 bars unless the genre demands them (e.g., guitar solo in Rock).  

---

## 5. Core Components of a Song in Suno  

Every Suno song is assembled from four **core inputs**. Handle these with care‚Äîthey determine how the model converts **text ‚Üí sound**.

### 5.1 Lyrics  
- Everything **not** inside square brackets `[ ]` will be **sung**.  
- Use only official section tags to shape structure: `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Refrain]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`, `[Instrumental Interlude]`, `[Percussion Break]`, `[Guitar Solo]`, `[End]`.  
- Syllable counts and line breaks act like **rhythm and phrasing cues**; keep parallel lines similar in length.  
- Do **not** include admin text like ‚ÄúLyrics:‚Äù in the lyrics box‚ÄîSuno will try to sing it.

### 5.2 Signature (SIG)  
- A **comma-separated** recipe of style descriptors (the model‚Äôs ‚Äúproduction brief‚Äù).  
- Follow the **Hierarchy of Importance**; front-load the first 3‚Äì5 items (e.g., `Pop, uplifting, female lead vocals, synths and guitar, polished production‚Ä¶`).  
- **Sweet spot:** 7‚Äì9 descriptors (‚âà8 commas). Longer SIGs are progressively ignored.  
- Keep language **short, parallel, concrete** (genre, mood, vocals, instruments, arrangement, production, energy/tempo, beat/bpm).

### 5.3 Exclusions  
- A separate, small **code box** listing ‚Äúdo-nots‚Äù that constrain arrangement/instrumentation.  
- Examples:  
 - no horns
 - no long solos
 - no distortion guitars
 - no rap verses
- Keep this list concise (3‚Äì6 lines). Do **not** embed exclusions inside the lyrics.

### 5.4 Title  
- End titles with `V()` for manual versioning.  
- Example: `"Acceptance (Risk Response) V()"`.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è *Key Concept:* Suno does not ‚Äúread music.‚Äù It parses **structured text**. These four inputs are its only lenses. Over-explaining or burying details leads to generic or ignored results.  

---

### 5.5 Advanced Options  

Once the basics are mastered, users can refine outputs through advanced options. These should be applied sparingly and intentionally.  

#### 5.5.1 Gender & Vocal Style Influence  
- Suno cannot guarantee a gendered timbre, but you can **steer**:  
- `female lead vocals, airy`  
- `male vocals, gritty low register`  
- `male‚Äìfemale duet, call and response`  
- For duets, encode contrast in **diction and rhythm** (short, punchy vs. long, lyrical) and mark sections with tags (`[Verse]`, `[Refrain]`, `[Chorus]`).

#### 5.5.2 Style Influence (Legal Copying)  
- Do not request specific copyrighted artists. Instead, guide legally via:  
- **Era:** `80s synthpop`, `90s grunge`, `2000s pop punk`.  
- **Fusion:** `folk rock`, `jazz fusion`, `blues pop`.  
- **Cultural descriptors:** `Motown-inspired`, `Nashville country`, `Britpop feel`.  
- Pair these with core genre to avoid drift: `Pop, uplifting, 80s synthpop flavor‚Ä¶`.

#### 5.5.3 Refined Exclusions  
- Tighten guardrails without overdoing it:  
- Arrangement: `no long instrumental breaks`, `no double chorus at start`.  
- Mix: `no heavy reverb on vocals`, `no overpowering bass`.  
- If a constraint is **critical**, promote it into the **front half** of the SIG (e.g., `vocals forward, instruments supporting vocals`).

#### 5.5.4 Uploads & References  
- Provide **original** or **public-domain** audio/text references only.  
- Acceptable: your demo, a self-recorded melody line, public-domain hymn/folk tune, legally acquired stems you own.  
- Reference phrasing: `match phrasing of uploaded demo; keep chorus length short`.

#### 5.5.5 Embracing Weirdness (Creative Descriptors)  
- Add controlled ‚Äúoddities‚Äù to explore textures:  
- `lo-fi tape texture`, `dreamlike, distorted backing`, `psychedelic layers`, `minimalist, hypnotic groove`.  
- Use **sparingly** and keep them **after** core signals. Too many experimental cues ‚Üí incoherent output.

#### 5.5.6 Weirdness & Style Influence Sliders (Manual Controls)  
- These are **interface sliders**, not SIG entries. They are adjusted manually after the SIG is generated.  
- **Weirdness**  
- Low (0‚Äì30%) ‚Üí safe, predictable.  
- Medium (40‚Äì60%) ‚Üí balanced creativity (default).  
- High (70‚Äì100%) ‚Üí experimental, surprising, sometimes chaotic.  
- **Style Influence**  
- Low (0‚Äì30%) ‚Üí looser interpretation, more genre blending.  
- Medium (40‚Äì60%) ‚Üí balanced fidelity to style.  
- High (70‚Äì100%) ‚Üí strong adherence to descriptors.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use them sparingly ‚Äî both at 100% can create extreme or incoherent results. For first runs, leave around 50%.

## 6. Default Song Structures  

### 6.1 Generic (Commercial / Fun) Songs  

These are **conventional songs** intended for melodic enjoyment or style mimicry. They align with industry norms across genres like Pop, Rock, Country, Jazz, EDM, etc.  

**Default Commercial Song Structure =**  
- 2‚Äì4 Verses  
- 2‚Äì3 Choruses  
- Optional Bridge  
- Outro  

**Section Functions:**  
- **[Intro]** ‚Üí Often instrumental; establishes mood and instrumentation.  
- **[Verse(s)]** ‚Üí Deliver narrative or imagery. Each verse advances the story or mood.  
- **[Chorus]** ‚Üí Short, catchy, repeatable; the ‚Äúhook‚Äù of the song. Appears 2‚Äì3 times.  
- **[Bridge] (optional)** ‚Üí Provides contrast (key change, rhythmic shift, or lyrical twist).  
- **[Outro]** ‚Üí Fade, repeat chorus, or instrumental close.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Key Notes:  
- Guided by Appendix Taxonomy: *Genre*, *Mood*, *Arrangement*, *Energy*, *Tempo*.  
- Flexible: different genres emphasize different parts (e.g., EDM = extended drop, Jazz = solos, Country = narrative verses).  
- Length: ~2‚Äì4 minutes is standard for commercial viability.  

---

### 6.2 Teaching Songs (Mnemonic Sub-Genre)  

Teaching songs are a **specialized form** of the generic structure. They exist to encode definitions, highlight watch-outs, and reinforce memory.  

**Default Teaching Song Structure =**  
- 3 Verses (definition, distinctions, examples)  
- 1 Refrain (exam watch-outs)  
- 1‚Äì2 Choruses (mnemonic hook)  
- 1 Bridge (scenario/example)  
- Outro (study call to action)  

**Section Functions:**  
- **[Intro]** ‚Üí Always names the core concept.  
- **[Verse 1]** ‚Üí Defines the concept.  
- **[Verse 2]** ‚Üí Explains categories/types.  
- **[Verse 3]** ‚Üí Covers examples or misconceptions.  
- **[Refrain]** ‚Üí PMI-style exam traps or clarifications.  
- **[Chorus]** ‚Üí Chant-like repetition of the key term.  
- **[Bridge]** ‚Üí Scenario or applied example.  
- **[Outro]** ‚Üí Positive call to action (‚ÄúStudy this word‚Äù).  

‚ö†Ô∏è Key Notes:  
- Still guided by Appendix Taxonomy but stricter than fun songs.  
- Prioritizes *clarity* and *repetition* over artistic exploration.  
- Maximum length: 2‚Äì4 minutes (shorter than many commercial tracks to aid memorization).  

---

**Summary:**  
- **Generic/Commercial Songs** = flexible, industry-standard, guided by genre norms.  
- **Teaching Songs** = a structured *sub-genre*, adding mnemonic and exam-focused rules.  

## 7. Expansion Rules  

Default structures keep songs concise and predictable. But some topics (or genres) require more room. Expansion rules provide boundaries for adding content without losing clarity or listenability.  

---

### 7.1 Generic (Commercial / Fun) Songs  

- **Verses**  
  - Default = 2‚Äì4.  
  - May expand to **5‚Äì6 verses** for narrative-heavy genres (e.g., folk ballads, country storytelling, hip hop).  
  - Each verse must introduce *new narrative material*; avoid padding.  

- **Choruses**  
  - Default = 2‚Äì3.  
  - May repeat more (up to **4 times**) in dance genres (e.g., EDM, pop anthems) where hook repetition is expected.  
  - Keep chorus lines short and consistent to stay hummable.  

- **Bridge**  
  - Default = 0‚Äì1.  
  - May extend to **2 bridges** only in long-form storytelling (rock operas, jazz suites).  
  - Avoid overusing; too many bridges = structural drift.  

- **Instrumental Breaks / Solos**  
  - Default = 0‚Äì1 short break.  
  - May expand in jazz, rock, EDM where solos or drops are genre norms.  
  - Keep solos proportional (8‚Äì16 bars).  

---

### 7.2 Teaching Songs (Mnemonic)  
- Intro
 - default = 2-4 stanzas
 - Introduces the subject by name. Use standard names in intro to lock in the subject. 
 - Tell the listener why they are listening to this song. 
 - Promise the value to be delivered

- **Verses**  
  - Default = 3.  
  - May expand up to **6 verses** for complex topics.  
  - Each verse should focus on **one aspect only** (definition, categories, examples, misconceptions, etc.).  

- **Refrains**  
  - Default = 2.  
  - May expand up to **3 refrains** if the song has more than 5 verses.  
  - Each refrain should highlight exam traps or distinctions in different words.  

- **Choruses**  
  - Default = 2.  
  - May expand up to **3 variations** in long songs.  
  - Each chorus must keep the same hook line (the concept name), but slight variations reinforce memory.  

- **Bridge**  
  - Always 1.  
  - Used exclusively for **applied scenarios or case studies**.  
  - Never add more than one bridge in teaching songs ‚Äî it confuses memory flow.  

- **Outros**  
  - Always 1.  
  - Must close with a clear study reminder or motivational call.  

---

‚ö†Ô∏è *Key Concept:* Expansion should serve **clarity and reinforcement**, not filler.  
- In **fun songs**, expansion = artistic freedom (more verses, longer solos).  
- In **teaching songs**, expansion = scaffolding memory (more verses/refrains to unpack a complex concept).  
## 8. Lyric & Syllable Guidelines  

Suno v4.5 interprets **syllable counts and line breaks** as cues for phrasing. Unlike a human composer, it doesn‚Äôt read notation ‚Äî so clarity and rhythm must come from **consistent text structure**.  

---

### 8.1 Generic (Commercial / Fun) Songs  
- use appendix A genre decisions to develop the structure of "Fun" Songs

### 8.2 Tribute Songs: Usually written about someone by someone,
 - can be nostalgic
	 - a father remembering the birth of a daughter
	 - military man singing about an adventure or his buddies
	 - family member honoring a lost loved one
 	- rant - angry or sarcastic rip on the subject highlighting failings ( could be good natured (merle has to die)  or  angry (like before he cheats on me)
 - tribute songs can fall aways from standard verse counts depending on the subject matter and have the most flexibility in design parameters.
 - the primary goal of the lyrics of a tribute song is they lend themselves to the "Tone" (happy, sad, nostalgic, angry) intent of the writer,
	- pick genre based on tone. and match the song type to the mood and intent of the writer (angry most likely metal or hard rock, etc...)
---

### 8.3 Teaching Songs (Mnemonic)  

- **Verses**  
  - 8‚Äì12 syllables per line.  
  - 4‚Äì6 lines per stanza.  
  - Each verse must stay focused on one concept slice.  

- **Refrains**  
  - 8‚Äì10 syllables per line.  
  - Always 4 lines.  
  - Content = exam traps, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt confuse this with‚Ä¶‚Äù phrasing.  

- **Choruses**  
  - 6‚Äì9 syllables per line.  
  - 4‚Äì6 lines per chorus.  
  - Each line should repeat the **key term** at least once.  

- **Bridge**  
  - Flexible: 12‚Äì16 syllables per line allowed.  
  - Content = scenario or applied example.  
  - Must end with resolution to the chorus hook.  

- **Outro**  
  - 1‚Äì2 lines only.  
  - Must close with directive phrasing (‚ÄúStudy this word,‚Äù ‚ÄúRemember this concept‚Äù).  

---

### 8.4 Universal Golden Rules  

- **Consistency is King:** Parallel lines should have similar syllable counts.  
  - Bad:  
    - ‚ÄúAcceptance means we face the risk‚Äù (8)  
    - ‚ÄúNo plan, no fix, we let it be for now‚Äù (11)  
  - Good:  
    - ‚ÄúAcceptance means we face the risk‚Äù (8)  
    - ‚ÄúWe note it down, no special fix‚Äù (8)  

- **Line Breaks = Breath Marks:** Each new line = new phrase. Don‚Äôt run sentences across lines.  

- **Avoid Run-Ons:** One idea per line. Long explanations should be split into multiple lines.  

- **Use Simple Words:** Especially in teaching songs ‚Äî keep diction at a level that sings cleanly.  

---

‚ö†Ô∏è *Key Concept:* Suno sings what you give it, syllable by syllable. If lines are uneven or overlong, the phrasing becomes rushed or stretched. Keep it tight, consistent, and chantable.  

## 9. Production Best Practices  

Even with strong lyrics and structure, a song can fail if the **mix** buries the vocals or clutters the arrangement. Suno responds best when production cues are **clear, front-loaded, and restrained.**  

---

### 9.1 Vocals Must Lead  
- **Vocals forward** ‚Üí always specify this in SIG for teaching songs.  
- Keep vocals **3‚Äì5 dB louder** than instruments in the mix.  
- Reinforce in SIG: `clear vocals, vocals forward, instruments supporting vocals`.  
- Teaching songs rely on intelligibility; burying lyrics defeats the purpose.  

---

### 9.2 Instrumentation in Support  
- Instruments should **frame, not dominate** the vocals.  
- Use exclusions to suppress overpowering instruments:  
 - no long solos
 - no overpowering bass
 - no distortion-heavy guitars
- If a genre demands solos (e.g., Jazz, Rock, EDM), keep them **8‚Äì16 bars max**.  

---

### 9.3 Production Styles (Appendix tie-in)  
- **Polished / Studio** ‚Üí bright, radio-ready, clean mix. Best for pop, R&B, EDM.  
- **Raw / Lo-fi** ‚Üí imperfect textures, tape hiss, intimate feel. Best for indie, folk, punk.  
- **Live Feel** ‚Üí audience ambience, room reverb. Works for jazz, gospel, jam-band.  
- **Atmospheric / Cinematic** ‚Üí layered, big reverb, immersive sound. Great for ambient, synthwave.  
- **Minimalist** ‚Üí stripped-down mix, often vocals + 1‚Äì2 instruments. Ideal for teaching songs when clarity is top priority.  
- **Dense / Layered** ‚Üí complex textures; use sparingly in teaching songs, but acceptable for EDM or prog rock.  

---

### 9.4 Length & Runtime  
- **Teaching songs** ‚Üí let Suno decide. (Match BPM to syllable count to make sure the song does not time out; e.g., more syllables = higher BPM.)  
- Choose genre based on amount of song lyrics (if excessive, use higher BPM genres; e.g., avoid jazz and blues with heavy solo probability).  
- **Commercial songs** ‚Üí 2‚Äì5 minutes standard. Some genres (EDM, Jazz) stretch longer if the style demands it.  
- Suno often truncates or pads if asked for extremes (>6 minutes).  


## 10. Writing a Good SSIG  

### 10.1 BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)  
A **good SSIG** is about **10 comma-separated keywords**, ordered according to the Hierarchy of Importance.  
- Too few (<7) = under-specified, Suno defaults to generic.  
- Too many (>10) = Suno ignores later cues.  
- The sweet spot = 7‚Äì9 descriptors, but 10 is acceptable if concise.  

Example:  
`Pop, uplifting, female lead vocals, synths and guitars, verse-chorus-verse, polished studio production, medium energy, medium tempo, 4/4, 110 bpm`  

---

### 10.2 Filling the 10 Slots  

Each slot in the SSIG corresponds to a category from the Appendix. Always front-load the most important cues.  
The Keyword is the bottom level word you find as you drive down through a category

1. **Genre** ‚Üí The anchor. Must be first. (Appendix ‚Üí Genre list)  
   - e.g., Pop, Rock, Metal, Jazz, Country  

2. **Mood** ‚Üí The emotional tone. (Appendix ‚Üí Mood list)  
   - e.g., uplifting, dark, romantic, dreamy  

3. **Vocals** ‚Üí Who and how is singing. (Appendix ‚Üí Vocals list)  
   - e.g., female lead vocals, male duet, whispered airy vocals  

4. **Instrumentation** ‚Üí Sound palette. (Appendix ‚Üí Instrumentation list)  
   - e.g., synths and guitars, acoustic strings, brass section  

5. **Arrangement** ‚Üí Song structure. (Appendix ‚Üí Arrangement list)  
   - e.g., verse-chorus-verse, 12-bar blues, build-drop-build  

6. **Production** ‚Üí Mix style. (Appendix ‚Üí Production list)  
   - e.g., polished studio, raw lo-fi, cinematic atmosphere  

7. **Energy** ‚Üí Overall intensity. (Appendix ‚Üí Energy list)  
   - e.g., low energy, medium energy, high energy  

8. **Tempo** ‚Üí Broad pacing. (Appendix ‚Üí Tempo list)  
   - e.g., slow, medium, fast, very fast  

9. **Beat** ‚Üí Time signature. (Appendix ‚Üí Beat list)  
   - e.g., 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, 12/8, free time  

10. **BPM** ‚Üí Specific pacing (optional but precise). (Appendix ‚Üí BPM list)  
   - e.g., 70 bpm, 95 bpm, 120 bpm  

---

### 10.3 What Belongs in SIG vs Exclusions  

- **SIG = What you want**  
  - `Pop, energetic, female vocals, polished studio, 4/4, 120 bpm`  

- **Exclusions = What you don‚Äôt want**  
no horns
no long solos
no overpowering bass

---

### 10.4 Rules of Thumb  

- Be concise: short noun phrases, not sentences.  
- Keep order consistent (Genre ‚Üí Mood ‚Üí Vocals ‚Üí ‚Ä¶).  
- Don‚Äôt contradict yourself (`minimalist` + `dense layered`).  
- Don‚Äôt overload with 15+ descriptors. Suno drops the tail.  
- Don‚Äôt use artist names. Use legal style references (era, genre fusion, culture).  

---

‚ö†Ô∏è *Key Concept:* Think of the Appendix as your **menu of building blocks**. Pick one keyword from each category, in order, until you have ~10 descriptors. That = a good SSIG.  
üëâ Would you like me to draft a ‚Äúworked example‚Äù that shows:

### 10.5 Worked Example ‚Äî Building a SSIG Step by Step  

The Appendix functions like a **menu of building blocks**.  
Pick **one option from each category**, in order of importance, until you reach ~10 descriptors.  

---

Example filter:  
- 1. Genre  
  - 1.1 Pop ‚Äì Bright, polished, hook-driven, chorus-forward, radio-friendly.  
    - 1.1.1 Mainstream Pop ‚Äì Standard chart-driven pop, mass appeal, polished production.  
      - 1.1.1.1 Chart Pop ‚Äì Top 40 style, highly produced, catchy hooks, trend-focused.  

- Example Song: ‚ÄúFlowers‚Äù by Miley Cyrus (2023)  
  - Spotify link: [Flowers ‚Äî Miley Cyrus](https://open.spotify.com/track/3PVqGk8raPyfJFjMEr9L5v)  

---

**Example Final SSIG String (comma-separated):**  
`*Chart Pop*, uplifting, female vocals, synths and guitars, verse-chorus-verse, polished studio production, medium energy, medium tempo, 4/4, 110 bpm`

‚ö†Ô∏è This system is **bi-directional**.  
- Forward use: start with Appendix ‚Üí select 1 descriptor from each category ‚Üí concatenate into a SSIG string.  
- Backward use: provide GPT with a modern song (e.g., Spotify link). GPT uses the Appendix to classify Genre ‚Üí Mood ‚Üí Vocals ‚Üí Instrumentation ‚Üí etc. and returns a SSIG string.

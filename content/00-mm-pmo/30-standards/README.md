# README – [Folder Name]  

This README is **developer-facing**. It explains how this folder is structured and how it fits into the JASYTI Multimedia Knowledge Base.  
The corresponding `index.md` file in this folder is **content-facing** and will be published to the KB site.  

---

## Purpose  
- Define the scope of this folder (what type of content lives here).  
- Keep instructions for contributors or maintainers working inside this folder.  
- Ensure consistency with other KB sections.  

---

## Structure  
- `index.md` → content-facing portal page (published by Quartz/GH Pages).  
- `README.md` → this file; developer-facing notes.  
- Other `.md` files → content articles, guides, or examples.  
- `assets/` (optional) → supporting images, diagrams, or media used by this folder.  

---

## Notes for Developers  
- Follow [linking conventions](../README.md) described in the root developer README.  
- Add new content pages here and update `index.md` to include them.  
- Keep filenames lowercase, hyphenated, and descriptive (e.g., `suno-guide.md`, `example-lyric-sheet-title.md`).  
- Update `suno-glossary.md` (if relevant) when new terms appear in this section.

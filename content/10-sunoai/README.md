# Suno AI KB (README)

This repository is for my **Suno AI Songwriting Knowledge Base**.  
It collects structured guides, examples, and references to help write **lyrics and SSIGs** for Suno v4.5 and extend them into **music video production**.  

---

## Topic
The focus of this KB is **How to create songs with Suno AI**.  
- **Lyrics**: correctly formatted with tags, meta-tags, parentheticals, and expressive cues.  
- **SSIGs (Style Signatures)**: compact style prompts that control genre, arrangement, vocal tone, and mood.  
- **Examples**: complete lyric + SSIG sheets that show polished outputs.  
- **Music Video Guide**: turning lyrics into a storyboard with AI prompts, continuity references, and file naming conventions.  
- **Glossary**: central reference for all technical terms across the KB.  

---

## Structure
- All published content lives inside the `content/` folder (Quartz treats this as the site root).  
- The homepage for this KB is `content/index.md`.  
- Key pages include:  
  - `suno-guide.md` – master guide for lyrics + SSIGs.  
  - `example-lyric-sheet-I'll-always-remeber.md` – complete lyric/SSIG example.  
  - `guide-music-video-creation.md` – storyboard and AI prompt guide.  
  - `suno-glossary.md` – master glossary of terms.  
  - `index.md` – portal landing page for this folder.  

Each file begins with Quartz frontmatter so it renders correctly online.

## What I Learned About Structure
Quartz/Obsidian treat this folder as a self-contained KB:  
- **Authoring** happens in Obsidian with wiki-style links (`[[suno-guide]]`).  
- **Publishing** happens via Quartz + GitHub Pages, which converts this Markdown into a navigable site.  
- The difference: Obsidian vault for writing vs. Quartz/GitHub Pages for live publishing.

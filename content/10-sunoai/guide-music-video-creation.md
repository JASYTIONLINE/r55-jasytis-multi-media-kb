# Guide to Music Video Creation with Suno Lyrics  

## Introduction  
This guide explains how to turn **finished Suno lyrics** into a complete **music video production plan**.  
The goal is to map each lyric line to a **scene**, then build AI prompts for generating storyboard images.  
The process ensures visual continuity, reproducibility, and tight integration with the song timeline.

## Workflow Overview  

1. **Start with Final Lyrics**  
   - Only use *locked lyrics* (e.g., from a Suno-ready lyric sheet).  

2. **Create a Storyboard**  
   - Break the song down line by line.  
   - Assign each lyric line a `[Scene #]` block.  

3. **Write AI Prompts**  
   - For each scene, define visuals, references, and continuity requirements.  
   - Prompts should be cinematic and technically specific.  

4. **File Naming Convention**  
   - Each scene uses its lyric line in the file name:  
     - Example: `scene-1-ill-always-remember-the-song-they-were-playin.png`  
   - This locks the visual to the lyric so it never gets lost if lyrics are shuffled.  

5. **Timeline Mapping**  
   - Because file names embed lyric lines, images can be dragged directly onto a video editor timeline.  
   - You can rearrange sections without renaming images.

## Metadata (per video project)  

- **Song Title:** I’ll Always Remember  
- **Theme:** Memory, love, resilience  
- **Genre:** Melancholy Country Waltz

### Genre  
**Definition.** The musical category a song belongs to, shaping rhythm, instrumentation, vocal delivery, and mood.

### Continuity References  
- Definition.** Master images or anchor files (e.g., `sarah-master.png`) that guarantee consistent faces, props, and styling across all storyboard prompts.  
On the exam (music video context): continuity ensures visual alignment when shuffling scenes or generating multiple shots of the same subject.

### Mood Progression  
**Definition.** The emotional arc expressed by a song’s lyrics and music. It describes how the listener is carried from one feeling to another as the song develops.  
In *I’ll Always Remember*: Tender → Yearning → Desperate → Cathartic Release.  
For music video production, mood progression ties visuals back to the audio — ensuring the imagery reflects the song’s natural emotional flow.

## Storyboard Breakdown  

### [Scene 1] I'll always remember the song they were playin'  
- **Prompt 1**: Generate an image of Sarah (use `sarah-master.png` as the reference) sitting on a neatly made bed in a softly lit bedroom. She should appear reflective and slightly melancholy, gazing down at her lap. Maintain strict facial continuity with Sarah's reference.  
  *Style: cinematic, natural light, realistic skin tones.*  
- **File Name:** `scene-1-ill-always-remember-the-song-they-were-playin.png`  

### [Scene 2] The first time we danced, hearts gently swayin'  
- **Prompt 2**: Generate an image of Dave and Sarah (use `david-master.png` and `sarah-master.png` as references) noticing each other across a warmly lit dance hall. Capture them gazing from a distance through the crowd. Maintain strict facial continuity.  
  *Style: cinematic, ballroom lighting, sharp focus on faces.*  
- **File Name:** `scene-2-the-first-time-we-danced-hearts-gently-swayin.png`  

### [Scene 3] You held me close and I knew it was true  
- **Prompt 3**: Generate a medium shot of Dave and Sarah in a close embrace on the dance floor. Her head rests gently against his shoulder, his arms secure around her. Maintain facial continuity.  
  *Style: cinematic, warm spotlight on couple, soft focus background crowd.*  
- **File Name:** `scene-3-you-held-me-close-and-i-knew-it-was-true.png`  

### [Scene 4] That's when I fell in love with you  
- **Prompt 4**: Generate a close-up of Sarah’s face, eyes half-closed, serene and vulnerable as she realizes she’s in love. Dave’s silhouette is blurred in the background. Facial continuity required.  
  *Style: cinematic, golden light, shallow depth of field.*  
- **File Name:** `scene-4-thats-when-i-fell-in-love-with-you.png`

## Prompting Principles  

- **Continuity First:** Always use reference files (`sarah-master.png`, `david-master.png`) to preserve character identity.  
- **Style Lock:** Keep camera, lighting, and tone consistent across prompts.  
- **One Prompt = One Image:** Each lyric line should map to at least one image; you can expand to multiple variations if needed.  
- **Shuffle-Proof:** Because file names contain lyric lines, scenes remain tied to the correct lyric even if the song structure is reordered.

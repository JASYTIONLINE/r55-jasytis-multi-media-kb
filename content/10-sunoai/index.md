# Suno AI Songwriting Knowledge Base – HOME  

---

## Purpose  
This folder is the **How To Guide for creating songs with Suno AI v4.5**.  
It contains the essential documents you need to:  
- Write **Suno-compliant lyrics** that generate correctly.  
- Build and refine **SSIGs (Style Signatures)** to control style, mood, arrangement, and instrumentation.  
- See a full **worked example** with a complete lyric + SSIG sheet.  
- Extend your work into **music video production** with storyboards and AI prompts.  
- Reference a shared **glossary** of terms used throughout the KB.  

The goal: one cohesive system that takes you from **lyrics → SSIG → video** with consistent results.  

---

## How to Use This Site  

1. Start with the **Suno Guide** to learn rules, tags, formatting, and SSIG structure.  
2. Look at the **Example Lyric Sheet** for a polished full project.  
3. Use the **Music Video Guide** if you want to build storyboards and visuals.  
4. Keep the **Glossary** open while working — every term is defined and linked.
